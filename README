ION-UX Setup
============

Getting ION-UX up and running is straightforward once you have a Capability Container running. In a nutshell, there are three steps:

* Create virtualenv and install dependencies
* Configure FLASK and GATEWAY settings
* Launch Flask web application

1. Environment Setup
--------------------

It is best to setup a virtualenv to install the dependencies (Flask, requests).

	virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
	pip install Flask -E venv/
	source venv/bin/activate
	pip install requests

2. Configure
------------

	cp config_template.py config.py

For the most common scenarios (i.e. running the UI on your development environments), the settings will look like this:

* FLASK_HOST = 'localhost'
* FLASK_PORT = 3000
* GATEWAY_HOST = 'localhost'
* GATEWAY_PORT = 5000

3. Run
------

	python main.py

Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy.

### Current features (in progress)

* Flask powered API (using mock data and calls to the service gateway)
* Continued development of JavaScript/CSS.
* Development of dynamic layouts defined by JSON
